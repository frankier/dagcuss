Dependencies:

* Bulbs has poor error handling eg Rexster can return 405 method not allowed when an incorrect id type is used but since it's not in RESPONSE_HANDLERS an obscure exception is thrown instead
* Bulbs gremlin.groovy get_or_create_vertex_index has a race condition but it's probably due to Rexster's caching or some shit.
